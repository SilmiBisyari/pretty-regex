## Usage

Using Pretty Regex is straightforward. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

This will print the regex with syntax highlighting.

## Examples

Here are some examples to illustrate how Pretty Regex works:

### Example 1: Email Validation

```bash
pretty-regex '^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
```

This regex checks for valid email formats. The output will highlight different parts of the regex for easier understanding.

### Example 2: URL Matching

pretty-regex 'https?://[^\s/$.?#].[^\s]*'
```

This regex matches URLs. The syntax highlighting will help you see the components clearly.
